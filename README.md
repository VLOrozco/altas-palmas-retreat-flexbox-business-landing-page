## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to create a webpage starting mobile-first view, how to utilize flexbox properties, and how to use media queries!

I struggled for a while with flexbox and getting media queries to work before this project. I researched many sources and began working on projects through Frontendmentor.io to get more acquainted with working on these concepts. I am happy with the progress and all I learned through these projects!
